**TIP**: In Remotion you can use Compositions as a track in a video. You can even group (or nest) several Compositions inside a Composition. Each Composition can be started from the URL followed by the Composition ID (for example, https://mydomain.com/HelloWorld where the id of the composition is "HelloWorld").

**Tip**: Consider the possibilities when nesting a Canvas as with [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/react-three-fiber-headstart) inside a Composition, to create 3D Scenes!
